# RL-Unity

This is part of a study project using Reinforcement Learning to achieve automated parking in the simulation environment of [Unity](https://unity.com/). We choose Unity as the 





##### Environment

```
PyTorch==1.12+cu116
mlagents==
```



#### References

This project utilized part of the code and environment from this fantastic [work](https://github.com/VanIseghemThomas/AI-Parking-Unity). Some of the models (mostly cars) is retrieved from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/). We also learned a lot from [this](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/reinforcement-learning/ug/train-ppo-agent-for-automatic-parking-valet.html) demo by MathWorks. The referred paper is listed below
